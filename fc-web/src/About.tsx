        <h2>About the Mithril Almanac</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Zachary Shuford, and I created this site! <span role="img" aria-label="grin">ðŸ˜€</span></p>
        <p>If you find any bugs or have any issues, you can report them at&nbsp;
          <a href="https://github.com/Pharylon/MithrilAlmanac/issues">the project's Github page</a></p>
        <p>
          This site is free to use, and I promise that if I ever add a "paid tier" in the future, 
          it'll only be for new features. What's here as of right now will remain free as long as I operate the site.&nbsp;
          Plus, the code is free to resuse, remix, and rehost yourself if you want, as long as you don't use it for commerical
          purposes (the exact legal lisence can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Pharylon/MithrilAlmanac">Github</a>)
        </p>

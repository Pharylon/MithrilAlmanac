# This is the code for the Mithril Almanac

## Demo

The site is here: https://www.mithrilalmana.com

## Setup

These instructions are for Windows, because that's what I develop on. 

1. Install Node and all that Jazz.

2. You need to create a symbolic link so the fc-functions  and fc-web projects can share models. If you're on Windows, that looks something like this if you've cloned it into the repos folder `mklink /D Models "C:\Users\<username>\source\repos\MithrilAlmanac\fc-web\src\Models"`

3. Install Azure Functions Core Tools
